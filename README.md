Hello!

this project was a quick sampler platter for my instruction to both python and webscraping.
It doesn't do much and I don't intend to work on much more as of 9/27

It uses Selenium, beautifulSoup, and of course python to attempt to fetch prices for Honda Civic Type R's 


Doesn't do much more than that unfortunately.
